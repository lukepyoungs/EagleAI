**PureAI: Golf Swing Analysis** is an ongoing project designed to help golfers enhance their swings through AI-powered video analysis. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, this tool will provide detailed feedback on swing mechanics and track users' performance over time. The project aims to integrate these capabilities within a modern, user-friendly web interface.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **🏌️‍♂️ Swing Analysis:** In-depth AI-driven analysis of your golf swing.
- **📈 Performance Tracking:** Track and visualize your improvements.
- **🎥 Video Overlay:** Feedback directly overlaid on the swing video for clarity.

> **Status:** This project is currently in progress. Some features are still under development.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Python**, **TensorFlow/PyTorch** - For AI model development and training.
- **React** - To create a sleek, responsive front-end interface.
- **Flask/Django** - Serving the AI models and managing API endpoints.
- **OpenCV** - Handling video processing and analysis.
